🥾 My absolute favorite activity is spending time on the trails hiking with my pup, Tallie. I finally got around to scraping my Strava data using the `{rStrava}` package and created a heatmap of my activities using `leaflet` -- check it out on my [personal website](https://samanthacsik.github.io/about.html)! More recently, I've embarked on building a Shiny dashboard to make my map a bit more interactive and also add in some additional fund data viz. It's a work in progress, but you can check it out [here](https://samanthacsik.shinyapps.io/strava_dashboard/). Find the code for the map and dashboard on my [strava-dashboard repo](https://github.com/samanthacsik/strava-dashboard).
